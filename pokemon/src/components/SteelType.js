            Reflecting the indestructible nature of metal, the Steel type features the greatest defenses of all types, resisting 10 out of 18 types, in addition to the complete immunity to Poison-type attacks, including both Poison and Bad Poison status ailments, barring those inflicted by a Pokémon with the ability Corrosion. Steel-type moves are super effective against Ice, Rock and Fairy-type Pokémon. Steel-type Pokémon are not usually used offensively until the Fairy type was introduced, but they have always been great defensive physical walls.
