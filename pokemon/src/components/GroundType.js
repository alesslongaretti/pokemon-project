            The Ground type is also a mostly slow and physical type, hitting Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock and Steel super effectively while being immune to Electric-type attacks. However, similar to Rock-type, the power of Ground is hindered by the major weaknesses against Water and Grass, as well as having no effect on Flying-type Pok√©mon and those with the Ability Levitate.
