            The Ice type is another fragile type, being weak to the all-out offensive Fire-type and Fighting-type attacks, as well as Rock-type and Steel-type moves. Luckily, its unique strength on being the nightmare of Dragon-type Pokémon comes in handy. In addition, Ice-type attacks also hit Grass-type, Flying-type and Ground-type Pokémon super effectively. The Ice type is a usually bad type for defensive Pokémon as it only resists itself.
